    <h1>Championship Rules</h1>

    <h3>Race Sessions</h3>
    Sessions are on Monday evenings starting at 9pm.
    <br/><br/>

    We will complete at least one race in a session but can continue until the first person decides to withdraw for the
    evening. All subsequent races that evening will be non-championship events.
    <br /><br />

    <h3>Championship Race Points Awarded</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>10 points</li>
        <li>&nbsp;8 points</li>
        <li>&nbsp;6 points</li>
        <li>&nbsp;4 points</li>
        <li>&nbsp;2 points</li>
        <li>&nbsp;1 point</li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Aggressive Driving</h3>
    Excessive aggressive driving will be reported to the race steward (‘Xbox Record That’) for review with possible
    disqualification or championship points deducted.
    <br/><br/>

    <h3>Penalty Points</h3>
    Every driver starts with a clean license at the beginning of a championship.
    <br/><br/>
    Penalty points are then awarded for reckless driving or excessive contact between cars. More than 1 penalty point can be given for serious incidents dependant on the Race Stewards ruling.
    <br/><br/>
    1 penalty point on a license = 2 championship points deducted
    another penalty point on a license =  an extra 4 championship points deducted
    Each additional penalty point on a license = double the previous championship points deducted
    <br/><br/>
    So 5 penalty points on a license is –32 championship points.
    <br/><br/>
    Warnings can be given out which would amount to 0.5 a penalty point. Only whole penalty points equate to championship point deductions.
    <br/><br/>

    <h3>Game Settings</h3>
    Damage will be on Simulation.
    <br/><br/>

    Assisted braking and Racing line will be turned off.
